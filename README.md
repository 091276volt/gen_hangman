# Hangman Game

## Overview

The **Hangman Game** is a simple yet classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends. This project is developed as a personal exercise to improve programming skills and understand fundamental game mechanics.

---

## Features

- Randomized word selection from a predefined word list.
- Text-based user interface.
- Tracks incorrect guesses and displays the "hangman" progress.
- Allows players to see correctly guessed letters in the word as they play.
- Simple and user-friendly design for quick gameplay.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** None (uses built-in Python features)
- **Concepts Explored:** Loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and file handling (if word list is stored externally).

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the game script:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Guess one letter at a time.
   - Avoid repeating incorrect guesses.
   - Try to guess the word before the hangman drawing is completed.
5. Enjoy the game!

## Game Rules

1. A random word is selected, and its length is displayed as underscores (`_`).
2. You guess one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses result in the drawing of the hangman, step by step.
5. The game ends when:
   - You successfully guess the word, or
   - The hangman is fully drawn (maximum incorrect guesses reached).
6. You can choose to play again after each game.

## Code Structure

- **`hangman.py`**: The main script for the game.
- **Optional:** A text file (e.g., `words.txt`) containing a list of words for the game.

---

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Add support for multiplayer mode.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Integrate more word categories and difficulty levels.
- Save high scores for repeated play.
